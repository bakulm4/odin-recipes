    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I call this my weekday avocado toast because it's much simpler and faster than the from-scratch version I make on weekends. This one is inspired by the famous coffee chain's version and is ready in minutes, and portable if you need it to be! You can even top this with a fried egg if you'd like.
