    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This sandwich gets a crunchy finish with chips embedded into the bread. I use very special potato chips that were sent to me from Pennsylvania by my dear friend, MP. But if you can't find Utz®, your favorite chip will work just fine. Serve with more chips and pickles.
